1. Make a GET REST to http://api.fixer.io/latest?base=USD and then retrieve the foreign currency data and save it to variable. - **[AJAX]**
2. Create a new variable with the previous obtained data from the REST API call, but in this new variable, add 10.0002 to each values of those currencies. - **[Class, AJAX]**
3. Display both variables in a table - **[HTML, JQuery]**
4. For those values where its value is of even number, add a border colour of red to the table data. For those value where the currency is HKD, add a border colour of red to the table data as well. - **[HTML, JQuery]**
5. Create a function to check if the value is an even number. - **[Class]** 
(* remarks: Odd and Even number are only defined for integer. Therefore, I have created a function to check if the last digit of the number is even.*)
